Project concept:
Some data analysis to identify how inflammation changes over time after surgery.
Jane is a data scientist and Sam is a statistician.

We will need to decide who is doing what in the project.
We might need someone with programming skills.
They need to be competent in R and Python, matplotlib and ggplot.
Version control skills too.
